    "Last week we talked about variables, the types of values in variables, and one particular data type - lists. Lists important for holding and manipulating LARGE data sets. We learned some tool for manipulating lists, but were missing a big piece. Say you have a list of 5,000 measurements that you want to normalize by some value. Need to perform that division 5,000 times.\n",

    "Or often we have data as a table - rows, columns. Lets say a table of gene coordinates for 20,000 genes, and you want to find the length - for each row, subtract one column from the other.\n",

    "Solution is the FOR loop - computers are really fast at repeating the same action over and over. With FOR loops, you take advantage of that property of computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "For those of you who learned other languages, you've seen for loops. But they operate slightly differently in Python. For example, you may have learned about the concept of a foreach loop - distinct behavior from for. In python, for loops behave like foreach loops. If this is gibberish, don't worry."
